# Project 2 - Global Analysis of Banana Quality and Characteristics

## Overview: 

An interactive Python project that analyzes a dataset of a sample of 1,000 bananas harvested from eight different countries across the world in 2023. The user can access statistics on an individual banana or a set of bananas filtered by selected criteria through a terminal-based interface. The program also generates a two-part report containing summary statistics and key facts about the data. The first section presents a comparison of bananas divided by origin and type. The second section investigates the relationship between a bananaâ€™s physical characteristics and environmental conditions, such as the level of rainfall it received.

#### Known Issues

Related Issue: [#125235](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/125235)

Currently there is a bug with Python 3.13 and the `tkinter` library that may prevent the analysis report generation from functioning. A pre-generated report is provided in the repository while this issue is being resolved.
