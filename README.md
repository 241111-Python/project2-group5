# Project 2 - Global Analysis of Banana Quality and Characteristics:

*Description:* An interactive Python project that analyzes a dataset of a sample of 1,000 bananas harvested from eight different countries across the world in 2023. The user can access statistics on an individual banana or a set of bananas filtered by selected criteria through a terminal-based interface. The program also generates a two-part report containing summary statistics and key facts about the data. The first section presents a comparison of bananas divided by origin and type. The second section investigates the relationship between a bananaâ€™s physical characteristics and environmental conditions, such as the level of rainfall it received.
